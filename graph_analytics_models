    Basic Measures
VertexCount — the number of vertices
EdgeCount — the number of edges
Degree Measures
VertexDegree — the number of edges for each vertex
VertexInDegree — the number of in-edges for each vertex
VertexOutDegree — the number of out-edges for each vertex
Distance Measures
GraphDistance — the length of the shortest path between two vertices
GraphDistanceMatrix ▪  VertexEccentricity ▪  GraphRadius ▪  GraphDiameter
Connectivity Measures
VertexConnectivity — the number of vertex-independent paths between two vertices
EdgeConnectivity — the number of edge-independent paths between two vertices
Centrality Measures
ClosenessCentrality — inverse average distance to every other vertex
BetweennessCentrality — fraction of shortest paths that pass through the vertex
DegreeCentrality ▪  EigenvectorCentrality ▪  KatzCentrality ▪  PageRankCentrality ▪  HITSCentrality ▪  RadialityCentrality ▪  StatusCentrality ▪  EdgeBetweennessCentrality
Reciprocity and Transitivity
GraphReciprocity — fraction of directed edges that are reciprocated
GlobalClusteringCoefficient — fraction of length-two paths that are closed
MeanClusteringCoefficient ▪  LocalClusteringCoefficient
Homophily, Assortative Mixing, and Similarity
GraphAssortativity — within-group connectivity minus between-group connectivity
VertexCorrelationSimilarity — correlation similarity between actors
MeanNeighborDegree ▪  MeanDegreeConnectivity ▪  VertexDiceSimilarity ▪  VertexJaccardSimilarity ▪  VertexCosineSimilarity
